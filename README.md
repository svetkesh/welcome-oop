This project demonstrates some Python OOP concepts and functional programming approach.

_war.py_ is **'controler'** and **'view'** for this application.

_model.py_ handles data structures for application and implements **'model'** part. 

Clases: Card, Hand and Player in model.py are models for objects used in the game.

Truly speaking this project follows implementation task in beautiful Udemy course
'Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp' by Jose Portilla:

https://www.udemy.com/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/

It demonstrates some Python OOP concepts and also functional
programming approach.

There are some features you can find here:

class,
inheritance,
method overiding,
calling 'super',
@property,
raise and handle Exceptions,
pass-by-reference,
iterator example,
generator,
@decorator,
*args, * * kwargs,
list comprehension,
Python packaging,
modules,
_ _ slots _ _,
magic functions,
print formatting,
documentation,
and much more...

Hope I'll expand this with:

implementing MVC (sounds like a joke but it worth)

@staticmethod and @classmethod (first in the row)

_ _ hash _ _

implement decorator for class as once I've found in explanation about ABC

wrap with tests

Thanks you very much!
